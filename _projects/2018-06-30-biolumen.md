Biolumen is a prototype for a bicycle lighting system that utilizes flashing LED's as turn signals. The project was created in an independent studies course for Casey Reas. The course was centered around increasing cycling safety through the development of specialized electronics. Areas of research included micro-controller experimentation, statistical research, and product design.



### Objectives

The objective is to incorporate turning indicator lights in to a bicycle in order to improve safety among cyclists by improving communication with motorists around them.
