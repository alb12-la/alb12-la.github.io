One of the most prominent features of Solver's product is the Data Warehouse. The Data Warehouse allows a company to create an aggregation of all of their transactional data, which then is used for consolidated reporting, analysis, and creating dashboards.

The Gateway app, is a crucial part of the Data Warehouse as it allows for users to integrate their various on-premise data sources with the cloud-based Data Warehouse application. 

My role was to build this user interface from the pixel-perfect mock-ups that were delivered from our UX \| UI Design team. 


## Built with
- Angular (v.8)
- SASS Pre-processor
- Bootstrap (v.4)
- CSS Animations
