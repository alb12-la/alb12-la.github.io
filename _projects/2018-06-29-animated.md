I was hired by [Paranafilms](http://paranafilms.com/) to help create a prop for a commercial in which the lead actress would have a shirt that displayed live subtitles.

## Hardware
[Arduino Mega 2560 R3](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11061)

[3x Flexible 8x32 NeoPixel RGB LED Matrix](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2294)

[2x XBee Module - Series 1 - 1mW with Wire Antenna - XB24-AWI-001](https://www.adafruit.com/product/128)

The 3 Flexible LED panels are daisy chained together to create a 24x32 LED Pannel, Although, if I had to do this project again, I would use the [64x32 Flexible RGB LED Matrix - 5mm Pitch](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3803), which I don't recall being available when I first started the project. 

#### Wearable
Combines the Arduino Mega, LED panels, and an XBee to receive the signal from the operator. 

#### Operator
Uses the other XBee and the Xbee breakout to communicate to the wearable device.
