I currently have the privilege of being a contributor to an open source project known as [Batfish](https://github.com/batfish).     Most of my contributions have been to designing and implementing the project landing site that can be found at  [batfish.github.io](https://github.com/batfish/batfish.github.io) or naviating directly to `Batfish.org`
